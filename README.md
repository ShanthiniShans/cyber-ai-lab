SOC automation using AI | GenAI + Cybersecurity mini-projects | NLP, SIEM, threat detection
# 🔐 Cyber AI Lab – by Shanthini Kamaraj

This repository showcases hands-on mini-projects at the intersection of **Cybersecurity** and **AI**, built to strengthen foundational skills and explore real-world use cases.

## 💡 Why This Lab?
After completing certifications in Google Cybersecurity and Generative AI, I began experimenting with how AI can boost SOC capabilities and reduce analyst fatigue. This lab is my sandbox to build, break, and learn.

## 📂 What You'll Find

- **Foundational Skills** – Linux, Python, SQL, SIEM basics.
- **AI Use Cases** – NLP, anomaly detection, auto-ticketing, alert enrichment, and more.

## 🚀 Projects Snapshot

| Project | What It Does |
|--------|---------------|
| NLP Alert Summarizer | Uses AI to summarize long log entries into readable alerts |
| Anomaly Detection | ML-based log anomaly detector (Isolation Forest) |
| Ticket Generator | Converts alerts into formatted incident reports |
| Threat Enrichment Bot | Pulls threat intel to enrich alerts |
| Alert Fatigue Filter | Highlights high-priority alerts, reduces noise |

## 👀 Stay Tuned
This lab is continuously evolving. I’m logging everything I learn and build, and sharing the journey here.
